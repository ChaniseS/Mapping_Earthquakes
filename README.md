# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview:
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Through the 9 branches, the maps represent the isolated environments creating codes no matter the scope. 
## Deliverable 1:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

## Deliverable 2:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). You'll also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

## Deliverable 3:
Using the options from the Mapbox styles (Links to an external site.), add a third map style as a tile layer object to the challenge_logic.js file.
Add the map variable to the base layer object.![Screen Shot 2022-03-18 at 10 36 48 PM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95304025/159103602-f5176bd8-6553-46c1-8451-c154d16f7c38.png)
